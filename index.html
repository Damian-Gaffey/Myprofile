  <h1 style="color:#ffff00;">Welcome to My Profile</h1>

  <img src="me.jpeg" alt="me" style="width:318px;height:318px;">

  <h2 style="color:#cc0066;">About Me:</h2>

  <p>My name is Damian I reside in Perth Western Australia
     and I am currently studying Bachelor's degree of Information Technology
      online with RMIT.</p>

      <h3 style="color:#cc0066;">My Background:</h3>

      <p>I was previously a truck driver but have always had a passion for
        Technology.</p> <p>I have self taught myself in various things such as building
        my own pc's mainly for gaming and feel it is my time to pursue a career
        in the IT industry and expand my skills.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#cc0066;">My Ideal Job:</h4>

        <p>My ideal job in the IT industry is not clear as of
           yet as there are all various different fields out there.</p>
        <p> and I am not sure if I would end up being a software developer or
       if I would be a network administrator/engineer.
       This is why I am studying to find my niche and pursue that as a career.</p>
       <p>Here is an example of a job that possibly interests me: Seek.com.au IT technician</p>
       <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38263632?searchrequesttoken=ef49e846-5990-4717-98ea-b174187e77c4&type=standard">
         IT Consultant</a>
         <p>Some of the skills and experience needed which I am not going to include all as the list is relatively long are:</p>
         <p>Customer service, 3 years IT support experience, Windows server 2008 – 2019 and windows XP – Windows 10,</p>
         <p>Microsoft office experience, understanding of network technologies and hardware.</p>
        <p>To gain these skills I will be completing my Bachelor’s of IT through RMIT University alongside that I will try to gain extra skills and real world experience</p>
        <p>experience by seeing if any business would be willing to take me as a trainee to develop my skills and possibly help me with my studies </p>
        <p>while I am able to share my experience and what I have learnt with everyone else doing the same course.</p>
