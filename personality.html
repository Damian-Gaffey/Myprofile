  <p>I did some personality tests to work out where I am in the world and to help me learn more about myself</p>


  <p>The first test I did was a Myers-Briggs type test which indicated I am a defender:</p>
  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality">Defender</a>

  <p> For me personally I think this sums me up pretty well I am the quiet guy in the corner<br>
    but I am not just being quiet I am taking everything in analyising things to help solve the problem</<p>


  <p>The second test I did was a learning style test:</p>
  <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=8&V=6&T=6 ">Auditory</a>

  <p>This has always been a way of me learning with visual and audio it's how I learnt<br>
    to build this webpage by using youtube and to learn how to use github I am more of hands on.</p>

  <p>The last test I did was an IQ test to see if I am smart or not my result was 93-109:</p>
  <a href="https://www.123test.com/iq-test/id=LDWQWSOHYQNQ&version=">IQ Test</a>

  <p> I googled the value to see what scale I was at and it turns out I have superior intelligence<br>
    although that's what is stated I don't feel I have am more superior than others I always like other peoples views</p>
