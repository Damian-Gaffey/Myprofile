  <p>I am going to talk about 2 projects I have in mind.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#cc0066;">Project 1:</h2>

  <p>Firefighting is a tough and dangerous job it takes a certain type of person to put their life on the line to protect people and animals from death and property loss. But who protects them from being in harms way? Apart from their firefighting colleagues,<br>
    it’s a tough and harsh job dealing with unpredictable winds and conditions and intense heat.The reality is bush fires will never stop and will get worse in the future as our climate is always changing,how can we use technology to help these people and <br>
    try to preserve their lives while they are saving others?</p>

  <p>For my project idea I propose a solution which would take some time to implement but with the technology we have vastly available at our fingertips we should be able to have a solution.The project would be to have a radio operated vehicle (R.O.V) to help firefighters in the frontline to defend against our harsh environment.Police use this technology in their specialised units such as bomb squads to be able to operate a robot to diffuse explosive devices. Not only can it help protect firefighters but also be able to get to inaccessible areas.The R.O.V would need to be compact enough to be stored on firefighting vehicles as well as have long range capabilities.It can be operated from a small control console within the cab of a firefighting vehicles and be mounted with a camera such as a thermal imaging camera.For it’s water supply it can be hooked directly up to the firefighting vehicle via hoses the vehicle’s water pump would be able to provide the optimum pressure needed for firefighting and the R.O.V has a robust but smaller pump that is to output the water and or fire-retardant foam.</p>

  <p>The technologies that can be used would be robotics but to be built from materials that can withstand the high temperatures. Thermal imaging camera’s that are in high definition quality so firefighters can see what is going on. Gps guidance so that not only can firefighters see where the device is but also the command centre that is in charge of the incident. It also needs to have long lasting battery life possibly a lithium type battery, also needing to have strong and robust drive motors that can handle harsh terrain and heat meanwhile having longevity.Radio frequency technology would need to be used for the remote operation of the vehicle which will be long range bearing as well, the circuitry will need to be robust but also have enough inputs and outputs to serve ever function. Software wise would need to be specifically designed for purpose which would be quite complex but definitely achievable.The skills needed for this project will be knowledge of robotics how to build and develop the structure, mechanical engineering to be able to acquire mechanical components and or build them from scratch. Software development bye learning programming languages and being able to develop security features so no one can maliciously access the device and take control. It could quite possibly be operated on the 4g or 5g network to be able to live stream the camera feeds back to the operator.</p>

  <p>In summary this device could potentially save lives keeping firefighters safe from heat harsh terrain and also make it easier to defend against bush fires by getting to areas where it was never accessible before.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#cc0066;">Project 2:</h3>

  <p>The second project I’d like to talk about is how we can help with pre hospital care for major trauma incidents. As it is our health system is under tremendous strain and under resourced, doctors only have a short period of time to be able to diagnose and provide effective care for a better outcome for patients.</p>

  <p>What I would like to propose is with incoming patients in ambulances to have a better outcome and possibly make recovery times a lot quicker. I’d like to see and implement a new strategy to be able to have a new solution developed to better help not only the outcome of patients but also for our health staff to give effective care and early intervention and could possibly relieve health staff that are already under extreme stress.This solution would be to implement a live telemetry system from ambulances as it stands paramedics have to hand over patients to doctors and nurses giving them a basic run down of what has happened in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>This live telemetry system could give doctors and nurses better preparation for incoming patients and are able to prioritise what they need to do first whether it’s x-rays mri’s or CT scans or blood tests or if they need to go for immediate surgery. They would be able to see what the patient’s vital signs are doing from inputs of ecg machines etc.The technologies used are current and in place today with the use of 4g mobile networks, the biggest challenge would be security as to protecting the privacy of patients when they are most vulnerable. The system would take inputs from various data sources within the ambulance vehicle connected to a small hub and relay the information via the 4g network to a data centre which would then relay information to the hospital for treating doctors and nurses to have a better understanding.</p>

  <p>The key skills required for this project would be the ability to understand IT systems and setup and maintain a network and to have it as secure as possible, so I would need to learn about network design and engineering and communications along with network security. We can use the current 4g network that is being utilised as of today and possibly upgrade to the 5g network when it is rolled out. Another resource we would be using is the high-speed fibre optic internet network that is being rolled out across the country also know as the national broadband network that the government has implemented.</p>

  <p>These are a couple of ideas and projects that I would like to see in the future.
